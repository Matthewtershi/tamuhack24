        description: "Global warming is affecting the sustainability of the planet, and forest fires are causing a significant amount of damage to the exponentially growing amount of CO2 that penetrates and destroys our protective Ozone Layer. In fact, over the past 50 years, we have accumulated a similar quantity of CO2 than 1000 times the quantity of CO2 that would've accumulated naturally. Even though being 1000 times more environmentally destructive than nature isn't great, we hope our app can bring some awareness to this problem and encourage the preservation of our planet for generations to come.",

Our machine learning model changes this by providing real-time predictions of forest fire locations based on factors like temperature, humidity, and wind patterns. With a user-friendly interface, our app empowers users to visualize risk zones, enhancing community preparedness and fostering collaboration among local authorities to better respond to wildfire threats.",
